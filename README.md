# DevOps and Deployment Assessment

* In this assessment, you'll be answering some questions on the devops material that we went over.
* Answers to your written questions should be recorded in _Answers.md_.
* This assessment is to be worked on alone, but you can use outside resources and reference old repositories.
* Please refrain from copying and pasting any answers you previously wrote as an answer for a question on this assessment. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something.
* **Friendly reminder:** Don't fret or get anxious about this assessment. This is a no-pressure assessment that is only going to help show you where you need to brush up on when reviewing. This is NOT a pass/fail situation.

## Assessment Questions

* **RESEARCH AND THOROUGHLY** Answer these questions. This shouldn't take just a trivial amount of time. You should spend some signifigant time on this.

1. Describe the differences between a Docker container and a virtual machine. What makes a container more aptly-suited for portability?
2. Using the command `docker run -p 49160:8080 -d <your_docker_username>/<your_docker_image_name>`, what does `49160:8080` specify?
3. What is the main purpose of using a "container orchestration platform" such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm?
4. How do you change the number of replicas in a Kubernetes cluster?
5. What does it mean to scale a deployed application 'horizontally'? What does it mean to scale 'vertically'?
6. Heroku also utilizes software containers for deployment. What is the main difference between the 'free' tier of containers on Heroku vs. the paid tiers?

## Post Assessment

1. Now that you have spent the week learning about some deployment options, the main goal here is to get your personal projects up on the world wide web for all to see!
2. Once you get your project hosted, clean it up so people can interact with it at least a little bit. And if you feel so inclined, solicit feedback in the `show-it-off` channel in slack.
3. Another task you can do once you are done hosting your project is craft some really great documentation.
4. Lastly, continue pushing forward on your personal projects! Build features, figure out problems etc.
